      <p>I’m a frontend-focused engineer who works comfortably across design and engineering.</p>

      <p>
        I specialize in taking early designs, vague requirements, or partially built products and
        shaping them into clear, reliable applications. This often means untangling frontend
        architecture, fixing performance issues, and making sure what ships actually matches the
        original design intent.
      </p>

      <p>
        My work is centered on React, TypeScript, Tailwind, and Next.js, with backend integration
        and experience working with Web3 technologies. I work best in environments where
        requirements are still taking shape and technical quality matters.
      </p>
